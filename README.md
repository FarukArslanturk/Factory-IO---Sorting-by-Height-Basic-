# Factory-IO---Sorting-by-Height-Basic-
Factory IO - Sorting by Height solution using different brand of PLC's. Each time a new brand is used, a new directory will be created and uploaded as a solution.

TIA PORTAL and twincat 3 is uploaded so far. I used the same algorithm and structure for coding. Two project have minimal differencies. 

For TIA PORTAL, I uploaded some screenshots from program. To communicate Factory IO and TIA PORTAL, PLC SIM is used. In program, a special FC is used and can be found in the official website of factory IO.

For Twincat 3, Factory IO doesn't support direct connection. But you can configure modbus tcp communication between factory io and twincat 3.
